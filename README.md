# Data-Science
NIDDK (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases) research creates knowledge about and treatments for the most chronic, costly, and consequential diseases.
The dataset used in this project is originally from NIDDK. The objective is to predict whether or not a patient has diabetes,based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.
Build a model to accurately predict whether the patients in the dataset have diabetes or not.

PROJECT TASK
Devise strategies for model building. It is important to decide the right validation framework. Express your thought process.
Apply an appropriate classification algorithm to build a model.
Compare various models with the results from KNN algorithm.
